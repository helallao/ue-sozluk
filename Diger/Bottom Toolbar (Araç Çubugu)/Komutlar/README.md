# Komutlar

Üç çeşit komut vardır: Var, Cmd ve Exec. Eger "help" komutunu kullanırsanız, ekranda çıkan komutların bu üçünden oluştugunu görürsünüz. Komutların açılımı,
<br>
<br>
Var = Variable (türkçesi "degişken")
<br>
Cmd = Command (türkçesi "Komut")
<br>
Exec = Execute (türkçesi "yürütmek", "çalıştırmak")
<br>
<br>
Bu üçünün içinden ikisi aynıdır: Cmd ve Exec. Var ise, komut çalıştırmak degil de deger degiştirmeye yarar. Yaklaşık 5000 tane Var türünden ve yaklaşık 1000 tane de Cmd ve Exec türünden komut vardır ("help" komutu ile görebilirsiniz). Githubun 500kb README dosyası limiti oldugu için Var komutlarını burada anlatamicam, zaten anlatamam da. Sadece Cmd ve Exec komutları var.
